# Playground UI

**Craft beautiful, animated components with speed and confidence.**

A modern React component library playground built with Storybook, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Design, prototype, and ship UI components at scale.

## Why Playground UI

- **ðŸŽ¨ Design in the browser.** Storybook with hot reload means instant visual feedback. See every variant, state, and interaction in real time.
- **âš¡ Animations included.** Framer Motion is baked in. Smooth transitions and interactive motion are no longer an afterthought.
- **ðŸŽ¯ Fully typed.** TypeScript everywhere. Props, variants, and state are enforced. Catch mistakes before they ship.
- **ðŸš€ Build once, use everywhere.** Export components, stories, and tokens to your projects. Single source of truth.
- **â™¿ Accessible by default.** Built with semantic HTML and ARIA in mind. Components work for everyone.

## Get started in 2 minutes

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Storybook opens at `http://localhost:6006`. Start building.

For detailed setup, see [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

## Your first component

1. Create a component in `src/components/`
2. Create a story file (`ComponentName.stories.tsx`)
3. Add stories in Storybook
4. See it live at `http://localhost:6006`

See [docs/creating-components.md](docs/creating-components.md) for a step-by-step guide.

## FAQ

**Can I use this with Next.js / Remix / Astro?**  
Yes. Export components from this library and import them in your framework. No framework lock-in.

**How do I add animations?**  
Use Framer Motion. See [docs/animations.md](docs/animations.md) for copy-paste examples.

**Should I use component libraries like shadcn/ui?**  
Yes. This playground is where you create *your* components. Mix and match open-source components with custom designs.

**Can I publish to npm?**  
Yes. See [docs/publishing.md](docs/publishing.md) for a workflow.

**Is Storybook required?**  
Not strictly, but it's the best tool for designing and testing components in isolation. Highly recommended.

## Next steps

1. Clone or fork this repo.
2. Run `pnpm install && pnpm dev`.
3. Open Storybook at `http://localhost:6006`.
4. Create your first component in `src/components/`.
5. Write a story and see it live.
